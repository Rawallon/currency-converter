## Currencyversion
> For all you currency conversion needs!

This was a quick currency conversion project made using React and the [Foreign exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) in the style of [dolarhoje.com](https://dolarhoje.com/)!

> It uses both the name of the currency and its symbol

![ooh, fancy!](https://i.imgur.com/sNlOCfo.png)

This counts as a feature, right?

## TODO
 - Cleaner code and overall structure
 - Resizable input
 - Bigger font for higher screens?
 - Maybe some graphs?

 ## Running it

 ```bash
# Clone this repo
$ git clone <https://github.com/Rawallon/currency-converter>

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# To make it start!
$ npm start

# Horay!
```

## ðŸš§ As with anything in my profile this isn't the final version of it ðŸš§
